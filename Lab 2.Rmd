## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Exercise 1
```{r ex1}
x<-3
y<-15
y + x
y * x
y - x
y / x
```
  
##Exercise 2
```{r ex2}
x <- 2
y <- 3
x^5 > y^4
```
  
##Exercise 3
```{r ex3}
vctr<-c(22,62,148,43,129)
sum(vctr)
vctr /  sum(vctr)
```
  
##Exercise 4
```{r ex4}
nucleotide<-c("A","T","C","G")
sort(nucleotide)
```
